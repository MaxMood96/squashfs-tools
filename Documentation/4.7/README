	SQUASHFS-TOOLS 4.7 - A squashed read-only filesystem for Linux

	Copyright 2002-2025 Phillip Lougher <phillip@squashfs.org.uk>

	Released under the GPL licence (version 2 or later).

Welcome to Squashfs-Tools 4.7.  The last release was two years ago, and there
are substantial improvements to the tools in this release, in particular
Mksquashfs can now be 20% to more than six times faster (dependant on source
media and files).  The help system has also been completely rewritten and
improved for Mksquashfs/Unsquashfs/Sqfstar/Sqfscat.

Please see the top-level INSTALL file for instructions on installing the tools,
and the USAGE files in this directory for information on how to use the tools.

This README describes the improvements, and has the following sections:

1. Summary of changes
2. Parallel file reading and options
3. Help system and options
4. Author info

1. Summary of changes
---------------------

1. Mksquashfs now reads files in parallel from the input directories

   1.1. This can significantly increase I/O when reading lots of small files,
        and/or the input benefits from parallel reading e.g. modern SSD drives,
        or network filesystems etc.
   1.2. New -small-readers option to specify number of parallel small file
        reader threads (files less than a block size).  Default 8 threads.
   1.3. New -block-readers option to specify number of parallel block reader
        threads (files one block or larger).  Default 3 threads.
   1.4. New -single-reader option to specify a single reader thread, similar to
        previous Mksquashfs versions.

2. Rewritten and improved help system (Mksquashfs/Unsquashfs/Sqfstar/Sqfscat)

   2.1. Help text now uses the full width of the terminal (rather than being
        pre-formatted to 80 columns).
   2.2. The help text is now automatically paged (by default /usr/bin/pager is
        used).
   2.3. The tools now print a summary on failure to parse the command line (or
        encountering other errors that prevent the tool from running), rather
        than displaying the help text.
   2.4. The help text can be displayed in full, by section, or by option using
        regex matching.
   2.5. New -help-all option to display all help text
   2.6. New -help-section option to display help for a particular section
   2.7. New -help-option to display all options matching regex.
   2.8. New -help-comp option to display compressor options for given
        compressor.

3. Other improvements for Mksquashfs/Sqfstar

   3.1. New -force-file-mode option, which sets all file (non-directory)
        permissions to the given mode.
   3.2. New -force-dir-mode option, which sets all directory permissions to
        the given mode.
   3.3. -root-mode and above new -force-file-mode/-force-dir-mode options
        now take a symbolic mode in addition to an octal mode.
   3.4. New -info-file option, which prints files written to the filesystem to
        a file rather than stdout.  Allows -info-file to be used in conjunction
        with the progress bar.
   3.5. New -pseudo-dir (or -pd) option which supplies a default directory
        if any directories in a pseudo file definition pathname doesn't exist.
   3.6. New pseudo file 'h' definition which creates a hard link to a file,
        and follows symbolic links.
   3.7. Previously if a directory was missing (or not a directory) in a
        Pseudo file definition pathname, the pseudo file definition would be
        ignored.  This has been hardened to a fatal error.

4. Other improvements for Unsquashfs/Sqfscat

   4.1. New -mem option, which sets the amount of memory to be used,
        K, M and G can be used to specify Kbytes, Mbytes and Gbytes.
   4.2. New -mem-percent option, which sets the anount of memory to be
        used as percentage of available physical memory.
   4.3. Memory specified is limited to 75% of physical memory or less.

5. New environment variable SQFS_CMDLINE (Mksquashfs/Unsquashfs/Sqfstar/Sqfscat)

   If set, this is used as the directory to write the file sqfs_cmdline
   which contains the command line arguments given to Mksquashfs etc.  Intended
   to be used to debug scripts/discover what is being passed to Mksquashfs.


2. Parallel file reading and options
------------------------------------

3. Help system and options
--------------------------

The help system has been rewritten to remove the annoyances and limitations
of the previous system.  The previous system printed the entire help text
when a command line parse error occurred (or some other reason that prevented
the tool from running).  This behaviour may have been useful when the tools
had much less options, but when for example Mksquashfs now has 236 options,
the full help text is just too much, and it is multiple pages in size.  What
effectively happens is the actual error message scrolls off the screen and is
lost, and the user is left with a large help text display, most of which has
also scrolled off the screen, and the remaining part is of no interest
whatsoever.

The help system was first rewritten to avoid this annoyance.  Now, rather than
the full help being displayed on an error occurring, only a summary of the help
options available is displayed, where the user is directed to use the most
appropriate help option for their situation.

The second aspect of the rewrite was to move away from help text pre-formatted
to 80 columns, and to use the full width of the terminal, which is typically
much wider than 80 columns.  The effect of this, obviously, is to fit more
help text onto the screen.  Also the help text is now paged (by default to
/usr/bin/pager), and so if the output is larger than a screen, no information
will be lost.

For example, now if the user correctly spells an option, but, makes a mistake
with the argument, the user will firstly be prompted to look up the help text
for that option, and afterwards the list of other help options will be given,
e.g. (output uses 80 columns because this README is formatted to 80 columns)

Or run
  "mksquashfs -help-all" to get help on all the sections
*************************************************************************

The above ensures the error message is not lost, and the user is not swamped by
irrelevant information.

In doing so, this has introduced three new help options:

	1. -help-option <regex> (or -ho <regex> for short),
	2. -help-section <section-name> (or -hs <section-name> for short)
	3. -help-all (or -ha for short)

3.1 -help-option <regex>
------------------------

The -help-option option displays all the options that match the <regex> regular
expression, where matching is done on the option itself and the arguments,
e.g.

*************************************************************************
% mksquashfs -ho "regex"
-regex                  allow POSIX regular expressions to be used in exclude
                        dirs/files
-xattrs-exclude <regex> exclude any xattr names matching <regex>.  <regex> is a
                        POSIX regular expression, e.g. -xattrs-exclude '^user.'
                        excludes xattrs from the user namespace
-xattrs-include <regex> include any xattr names matching <regex>.  <regex> is a
                        POSIX regular expression, e.g. -xattrs-include '^user.'
                        includes xattrs from the user namespace
-help-option <regex>    print the help information for Mksquashfs options
                        matching <regex> to stdout
-ho <regex>             shorthand alternative to -help-option
*************************************************************************

Displays all the options that contain regex in their name or argument.

Using a regular expression, multiple things can be matched, for example, if you
wanted to return all the options that operate on uids and gids, you could do

*************************************************************************
% mksquashfs -ho "uid|gid"
-root-uid <user>        set root directory owner to specified <user>, <user> can
                        be either an integer uid or user name
-root-gid <group>       set root directory group to specified <group>, <group>
                        can be either an integer gid or group name
-force-uid <user>       set all file and directory uids to specified <user>,
                        <user> can be either an integer uid or user name
-force-gid <group>      set all file and directory gids to specified <group>,
                        <group> can be either an integer gid or group name
-uid-gid-offset <value> offset all uid and gids by specified <value>.  <value>
                        should be a positive integer
-pd <d mode uid gid>    specify a default pseudo directory which will be used in
                        pseudo definitions if a directory in the pathname does
                        not exist.  This also allows pseudo definitions to be
                        specified without specifying all the directories in the
                        pathname.  The definition should be quoted
-pd <D time mode u g>   specify a default pseudo directory which will be used in
                        pseudo definitions if a directory in the pathname does
                        not exist.  The D type also allows a timestamp to be
                        specified in addition to mode, uid and gid
-default-uid <value>    tar files often do not store uids for intermediate
                        directories.  This option sets the default directory
                        owner to <value>, rather than the user running
                        Mksquashfs.  <value> can be either an integer uid or
                        user name.  This also sets the root directory uid
-default-gid <value>    tar files often do not store gids for intermediate
                        directories.  This option sets the default directory
                        group to <value>, rather than the group of the user
                        running Mksquashfs.  <value> can be either an integer
                        uid or group name.  This also sets the root directory
                        gid
*************************************************************************

3.2 -help-section <section>
---------------------------

The -help-section option displays the section that matches the <section> name.
If <section> does not exactly match a section name, it is treated as a regular
expression, and all section names that match are displayed.  Finally, if
<section> is "sections" or "h", a list of sections and their names is displayed.

For example:

*************************************************************************
% mksquashfs -help-section compression
Filesystem compression options:
-b <block-size>         set data block to <block-size>.  Default 128 Kbytes.
                        Optionally a suffix of K, KB, Kbytes or M, MB, Mbytes
                        can be given to specify Kbytes or Mbytes respectively
-comp <comp>            select <comp> compression.  Run -help-comp <comp> to get
                        compressor options for <comp>, or <all> for all the
                        compressors.
                        Compressors available:
                                gzip (default)
                                lzo
                                lz4
                                xz
                                zstd
-noI                    do not compress inode table
-noId                   do not compress the uid/gid table (implied by -noI)
-noD                    do not compress data blocks
-noF                    do not compress fragment blocks
-noX                    do not compress extended attributes
-no-compression         do not compress any of the data or metadata.  This is
                        equivalent to specifying -noI -noD -noF and -noX
*************************************************************************

Will display the compression options section.

Using regular expression matching section names can be abbreviated, for example
"comp" will also display the compression options section.  But, it also means
multiple sections can be displayed, for example:

*************************************************************************
% mksquashfs -help-section "comp|build"
Filesystem compression options:
-b <block-size>         set data block to <block-size>.  Default 128 Kbytes.
                        Optionally a suffix of K, KB, Kbytes or M, MB, Mbytes
                        can be given to specify Kbytes or Mbytes respectively
-comp <comp>            select <comp> compression.  Run -help-comp <comp> to get
                        compressor options for <comp>, or <all> for all the
                        compressors.
                        Compressors available:
                                gzip (default)
                                lzo
                                lz4
                                xz
                                zstd
-noI                    do not compress inode table
-noId                   do not compress the uid/gid table (implied by -noI)
-noD                    do not compress data blocks
-noF                    do not compress fragment blocks
-noX                    do not compress extended attributes
-no-compression         do not compress any of the data or metadata.  This is
                        equivalent to specifying -noI -noD -noF and -noX

Filesystem build options:
-tar                    read uncompressed tar file from standard in (stdin)
-no-strip               act like tar, and do not strip leading directories from
                        source files
-tarstyle               alternative name for -no-strip
-cpiostyle              act like cpio, and read file pathnames from standard in
                        (stdin)
-cpiostyle0             like -cpiostyle, but filenames are null terminated.  Can
                        be used with find -print0 action
-reproducible           build filesystems that are reproducible (default)
-not-reproducible       build filesystems that are not reproducible
-no-exports             do not make filesystem exportable via NFS (-tar default)
-exports                make filesystem exportable via NFS (default)
-no-sparse              do not detect sparse files
-no-tailends            do not pack tail ends into fragments (default)
-tailends               pack tail ends into fragments
-no-fragments           do not use fragments
-no-duplicates          do not perform duplicate checking
-no-hardlinks           do not hardlink files, instead store duplicates
-keep-as-directory      if one source directory is specified, create a root
                        directory containing that directory, rather than the
                        contents of the directory
*************************************************************************

Will display the compression options and build options sections.

3.3 -help-all
-------------

The -help-all option displays all the help text, and it is similar to the
behaviour of -help in previous Squashfs tools versions, except that the
output is to a pager and not stdout.

3.4. PAGER environment variable
-------------------------------

By default the tools use /usr/bin/pager as the pager to output the help text.
If that isn't available, the tools will try less, /usr/bin/less, more,
/usr/bin/more, cat and /usr/bin/cat in that order.

The default pager used can be over-ridden using the PAGER environment variable.
If the filename given by PAGER doesn't contain slashes, the PATH environment
variable will be used to locate it, otherwise it will be treated as a pathname.
